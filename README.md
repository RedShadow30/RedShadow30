## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Asmitha aka @RedShadow30
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in spearheading **real-world problems** with my growing skillset.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **full stack development**.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I did 100 pushups (with no break) after being challenged. Never give up!

#### Some of my Projects include:
- Interactive Maps Web App : Using Pandas, Streamlit, & Folium
- ASCII Animal Art Generator : Using Spring Boot & Core Java

Thank you!
